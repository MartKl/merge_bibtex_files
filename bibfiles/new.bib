  Abstract                 = {Boson sampling is a computational task strongly believed to be hard for classical computers, but efficiently solvable by orchestrated bosonic interference in a specialized quantum computer. Current experimental schemes, however, are still insufficient for a convincing demonstration of the advantage of quantum over classical computation. A new variation of this task, scattershot boson sampling, leads to an exponential increase in speed of the quantum device, using a larger number of photon sources based on parametric down-conversion. This is achieved by having multiple heralded single photons being sent, shot by shot, into different random input ports of the interferometer. We report the first scattershot boson sampling experiments, where six different photon-pair sources are coupled to integrated photonic circuits. We use recently proposed statistical tools to analyze our experimental data, providing strong evidence that our photonic quantum simulator works as expected. This approach represents an important leap toward a convincing experimental demonstration of the quantum computational supremacy.},

This SPAD is sensitive in the range 400-1000nm and has a conventional reach-through structure which ensures good quantum efficiency at the long end of the spectrum. By use of passive and active quenching schemes we investigate detection efficiency, timing jitter, dark counts, afterpulsing, gain and other important parameters and compare them to the ``standard'' low noise SPAD C30902SH from Perkin Elmer. We conclude that SAP500 offers better combination of detection efficiency, low noise and timing precision.},

abstract={The testing of binary hypotheses is developed from an information-theoretic point of view, and the asymptotic performance of optimum hypothesis testers is developed in exact analogy to the asymptotic performance of optimum channel codes. The discrimination, introduced by Kullback, is developed in a role analogous to that of mutual information in channel coding theory. Based on the discrimination, an error-exponent function e(r) is defined. This function is found to describe the behavior of optimum hypothesis testers asymptotically with block length. Next, mutual information is introduced as a minimum of a set of discriminations. This approach has later coding significance. The channel reliability-rate function E(R) is defined in terms of discrimination, and a number of its mathematical properties developed. Sphere-packing-like bounds are developed in a relatively straightforward and intuitive manner by relating e(r) and E (R) . This ties together the aforementioned developments and gives a lower bound in terms of a hypothesis testing model. The result is valid for discrete or continuous probability distributions. The discrimination function is also used to define a source code reliability-rate function. This function allows a simpler proof of the source coding theorem and also bounds the code performance as a function of block length, thereby providing the source coding analog of E (R) .},
